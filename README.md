Hello, my name is Limeboy0603, and by now you may have realized that you reading this README file has happened exactly the way it was supposed to. You see, everyone who comes to my GitHub profile does so because they feel they are no longer in control in something important to them. But, more often than not, the problem is not that the software bugs we face can't be solved, The problem is that we become so afraid of software bugs that we refuse to see these bugs from a new perspective and so we got booted out of the software again and again and again. And therein of course, we find exactly the failure we were looking for.

Your programming career will always be a struggle and you will always have problems. But everyday, you had the chance to see things differently. Even though it meant debugging the software that seemed impossible at first, you thought outside the box - and you overcame them. Because you saw lines of code from every angle, you understood them for what they really were . Because you kept typing them, no matter how far off the path you were told you were headed, or how unexpected it became...you found your way.

In a few minutes, you'll leave my GitHub profile page, and some part of you will say that this is just an edit of the ending speech from the game Superliminal: So how could it have meant anything? But - just like the power of code itself - it will have been as real as you told it to be. All you've got to do is...type...code.
